### CONTRIBUTIONS
1. AFFAN MOHAMMED SHAFI ABDA  
> I wrote the code for the Trigonometric Functions. Those included the values of sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant of the inputted angles.
> All of the above functions were given in a switch case.  
> case 1 : Sine of the Angle  
> case 2 : Cosine of the Angle  
> case 3 : Tangent of the Angle  
> case 4 : Cotangent of the Angle  
> case 5 : Secant of the Angle  
> case 6 : Cosecant of the Angle  
> A default case was also given, if the user selects any other option other than the options available.
2. B S DEV DARSH  
> I wrote the code for finding the Basic Functions. The basic functions available are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, cube, cube root, reciprocal and power.
> All the functions were given inside the switch case.  
> case 1 : Addition  
> case 2 : Subtraction  
> case 3 : Multiplication  
> case 4 : Division  
> case 5 : Square  
> case 6 : Square Root  
> case 7 : Cube  
> case 8 : Cube Root  
> case 9 : Reciprocal  
> case 10 : Power  
> A default case was also given for if the user selects any other option other than the options available.  
3. JENSEN JOSE SAJAN  
> I wrote the code for Matrix Functions. My part included matrix multiplication, transpose of a matrix, to check whether a matrix is symmetric or not and norm of a matrix.
> All the above functions were given inside the switch case.  
> case 3 : Multiplication  
> case 5 : Transpose  
> case 6 : Symmetric or not  
> case 7 : Norm  
> A default case was also given, if the user selects any other option other than the options available.  
I also created a while loop to make this process infinite untill 1 is given in the input option. The initial infrastructure of the program was done by myself and the libraries were added and corrections were also made.
4. NIRANJAN R  
> I wrote the code to find the Factorial Function. Those include the factorial, permutaion and combination of the inputed number.
> Above function were given in a switch case.  
> case 1 : To find the Factorial of a number.  
> case 2 : To find the permutaion.  
> case 3 : To find the combination.  
> A default case was also given,if the user was not inputting the correct case number.  
5. RAAJ RAMESH  
> I wrote the code for Matrix Functions. My part included matrix addition, matrix subtraction and trace of a matrix.
> Above functions were given inside the switch case.  
> case 1 : Addition  
> case 2 : Subtraction  
> case 4 : Trace  
> A default case was also given, if the user selects any other option other than the options available.  
6. Snith Shibu  
> I wrote the code for the Inverse Trigonometric Functions. Those included inverse angle of sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant of the inputed values.  
> All of the above functions were given in a switch case.  
> case 7 : Inverse of the Sine of the Angle  
> case 8 : Inverse of the Cosine of the Angle  
> case 9 : Inverse of the Tangent of the Angle  
> case 10 : Inverse of the Cotangent of the Angle  
> case 11 : Inverse of Secant of the Angle  
> case 12 : Inverse of Cosecant of the Angle  
> A default case was also given, if the user selects any other option other than the options available.  
> I also created a function for adding line breaks/section dividers within the code. In the function 'line_break', I added a 'for-loop' which would print a star pattern. This would then be called within the function, whenever a line break was necessary.
