### CONTRIBUTIONS
1. AFFAN MOHAMMED SHAFI ABDA
> Fill your part here
2. B S DEV DARSH
> I wrote the code for finding the basic functions. The basic functions available are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, cube, cube root, reciprocal and power. All the functions are 
  given inside the switch function.  
> case 1 - Addition  
> case 2 - Subtraction  
> case 3 - Multiplication  
> case 4 - Division  
> case 5 - Square  
> case 6 - Square Root  
> case 7 - Cube  
> case 8 - Cube Root  
> case 9 - Reciprocal  
> case 10 - Power  
> A default case is also given for if the user selects any other option other than the options available.

6. Snith Shibu
> I wrote the code to find the inverse trigonometric values of the angles. 
> Those included the inverse values of sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant of the inputed angles.
> All of the above functions were given in a switch case.
> case 7: Inverse of the Sine of the Angle
> case 8: Inverse of the Cosine of the Angle
> case 9: Inverse of the Tangent of the Angle
> case 10: Inverse of the Cotangent of the Angle
> case 11: Inverse of Secant of the Angle
> case 12: Inverse of Cosecant of the Angle
> I also contributed by creating a function for adding line breaks/section dividers. In the function 'line_break', I added a 'for-loop' which would print a star pattern. This would then be called within the function, whenever a line break was necessary.
